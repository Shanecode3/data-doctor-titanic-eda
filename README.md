# Data Doctor: Titanic EDA & Cleaning

This project is part of my hands-on MLOps learning series.

## Whatâ€™s inside:
- Data loading and inspection with pandas
- Cleaning missing values (median/mode/drop)
- Data visualization (matplotlib & seaborn)
- Feature engineering: created new FamilySize feature
- All code and reasoning explained step-by-step

## Why it matters
- Demonstrates real-world data wrangling and exploration
- Shows how to prep a dataset for machine learning

**Built as Week 1 of my MLOps portfolio journey.**
